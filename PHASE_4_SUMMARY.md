  - `uploadImage()` - Server-side upload with automatic optimization
  - Image transformation: 800x800 max, quality optimization, format auto-selection
  - CDN delivery for fast image loading

- **Client-side Compression**:
  - Two-stage compression strategy
  - Primary: 1200px @ 80% quality
  - Fallback: 800px @ 60% quality (if still > 2MB)
  - Canvas API-based compression
  - Progress indicator during upload

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- No new schema changes required (existing schema fully supported admin features)
- Utilized `SystemConfig` table for ordering window management
- Leveraged `Customization` table for menu item options

### API Architecture
- RESTful endpoints following project conventions
- Role-based authentication middleware (admin-only routes)
- Comprehensive input validation
- Proper error handling with meaningful messages

### Frontend Architecture
- **Components Created**:
  - `AdminDashboard.tsx` - Main admin page with tab navigation
  - `MenuManagement.tsx` - Complete menu management interface
  - `UserManagement.tsx` - User administration table
  - `SystemConfig.tsx` - System configuration forms

- **State Management**:
  - Local component state for forms and UI controls
  - AuthContext integration for role-based access
  - No additional global state needed

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **View Mode System**: Used toggle buttons with icons (instead of text) for compact, clean UI
2. **Image Compression**: Client-side compression before upload to reduce bandwidth and storage costs
3. **Self-Protection**: Backend validation prevents admins from accidentally locking themselves out
4. **Search Implementation**: Client-side filtering for responsive search experience (suitable for expected user base)
5. **Pagination**: 20 users per page balances performance and usability
6. **No 8-Hour Restriction**: Removed arbitrary ordering window limit per user feedback

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Design
- Consistent Material-UI theming throughout
- Card-based layouts for visual appeal
- Proper spacing and padding (p: 3 on all containers)
- Equal-height cards using flexbox
- Icon-based toggles with tooltips for compact interface

### User Experience
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: All destructive actions require confirmation
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators for async operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation messages for completed actions
- **Contextual Information**: Smart chip display based on current view mode
- **Tooltips**: Helpful tooltips on compact UI elements

---

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Menu item CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Image upload with compression
- ✅ User role management with self-protection
- ✅ User activation/deactivation
- ✅ Ordering window configuration

### Edge Cases Handled
- Empty states (no menu items, no users)
- Invalid time formats
- End time before start time
- Self-demotion prevention
- Self-deactivation prevention
- Large image file handling
- Duplicate customization names

   - User activity logs
   - Last login timestamp
   - Bulk role updates
   - User statistics

3. **System Configuration**:
   - Holiday schedule configuration
   - Multiple ordering windows per day
   - Email notification settings
   - Payment processing configuration

4. **General**:
   - Dark mode support
   - Advanced analytics dashboard
   - Mobile app for admins
   - Audit trail for all admin actions
