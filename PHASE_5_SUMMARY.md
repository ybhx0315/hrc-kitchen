**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Dates**: October 8-9, 2025
**Key Achievement**: All reporting features delivered with polished UI/UX

## What Was Built

### Core Features
1. **Dynamic Reporting System** - Finance can generate custom date range reports
2. **Kitchen Printing** - Professional batch summary with CSS Grid layout
3. **Stripe Receipts** - Automatic email receipts on payment
4. **Enhanced Order History** - Date filters and pagination for all users
5. **Reports Navigation** - Top-level access (not buried in Admin)
6. **CSV Exports** - Authenticated downloads for all report types

### UI/UX Polish
- Print layout: 4-column grid (Customer | Order# | Details | Qty)
- Print button: Moved to page header (top-right)
- Reports filters: 4-column responsive layout with aligned heights
- Authentication: Proper Bearer token patterns (no URL tokens)
- Navigation: Reports separated from Admin Dashboard

## Key Files Modified

**Backend**:
- `kitchen.service.ts` - Print HTML with CSS Grid
- `report.service.ts` - New reporting service (363 lines)
- `payment.service.ts` - Added receipt_email
- `order.service.ts` - Pagination support

**Frontend**:
- `ReportsPage.tsx` - New top-level page
- `KitchenDashboard.tsx` - Print button in header
- `Layout.tsx` - Reports navigation

## Technical Decisions

1. **Stripe receipts** instead of custom PDFs (pragmatic MVP)
2. **Bulk printing** instead of per-order tickets (kitchen workflow)
3. **CSS Grid** for print layout (vertical alignment)
4. **Blob downloads** for authenticated files (secure)
5. **Top-level Reports** nav (UX improvement)
