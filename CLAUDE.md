## Technical Setup

### Database
- **Provider**: Neon PostgreSQL (cloud-hosted)
- **Connection**: Configured in `backend/.env`
- **Migrations**: Run via `npm run db:migrate` in backend
- **Seeding**: Test data available via `npm run db:seed`

### Test Accounts
After seeding, the following accounts are available:
- **Admin**: admin@hrc-kitchen.com / Admin123!
- **Kitchen**: kitchen@hrc-kitchen.com / Kitchen123!
- **Staff**: staff@hrc-kitchen.com / Staff123!

### Running Locally
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts both backend (port 3000) and frontend (port 5173)
```

### Testing Apple Pay / Google Pay
**Development Testing:**
- **Apple Pay**: Use Safari on macOS/iOS with Apple Pay configured
- **Google Pay**: Requires HTTPS on desktop Chrome
  - Option 1: Test on Android device via local network (`http://192.168.0.9:5173`)
  - Option 2: Use ngrok for HTTPS tunnel (`ngrok http 5173`)
  - Option 3: Deploy to staging environment with HTTPS (Vercel, Netlify)
- Payment Request Button automatically detects and shows available payment methods
- Test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, any CVC

**Production:**
- Works automatically on HTTPS domains
- No special configuration needed

### Data Flow

**Authenticated User Flow:**
1. User browses menu and adds items to cart (with customizations and variations)
2. Variation selector shows available options with dynamic price calculation
3. Cart persisted to localStorage with selected variations
4. Checkout creates order and Stripe PaymentIntent with user ID
5. User selects payment method:
   - **Apple Pay/Google Pay**: One-click payment (if available on device/browser)
   - **Card**: Enters card details via Stripe Elements
6. Payment confirmed → Order status updated → Redirect to confirmation
7. User can view order history and details with variations
8. Kitchen dashboard displays orders with user information and variation selections

**Guest User Flow:**
1. Guest browses menu without login and adds items to cart
2. Cart persisted to localStorage (survives across login/logout)
3. At checkout, guest enters firstName, lastName, and email
4. System checks if email already exists:
   - If exists: Shows dialog prompting guest to sign in
   - If new: Creates guest order with guest information
5. Guest selects payment method:
   - **Apple Pay/Google Pay**: Payment method provides name/email automatically
   - **Card**: Uses manually entered guest information
6. Checkout creates order and Stripe PaymentIntent with guest email (for receipt)
7. Payment confirmed → Order status updated → Redirect to confirmation
8. Order confirmation page offers optional account creation
9. Kitchen dashboard displays guest orders with guest name and email

**Payment Request Button (Apple Pay/Google Pay):**
- Automatically detects browser/device capabilities using `stripe.paymentRequest().canMakePayment()`
- Shows only when user's device supports Apple Pay or Google Pay
- Extracts payer name and email from payment method for guest checkout
- Unified payment flow with same order creation and confirmation process
- Falls back to card payment if digital wallet not available

## Development Guidelines

### Process Management
**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT kill processes or start/restart the backend and frontend servers automatically.
- The developer will manage `npm run dev` manually
- When server restart is needed, notify the developer to restart it themselves
- You may check process output using BashOutput tool, but do not kill or restart services

### Notes
- All project requirements, architecture decisions, and specifications are documented in the PRD
- See `GETTING_STARTED.md` for detailed setup instructions
- Backend API documentation follows RESTful conventions at `/api/v1/*`
- Stripe test mode enabled - use test cards for payment testing
- Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, any CVC

### Security Notes
- **CORS**: Environment-aware configuration
  - Development: Allows localhost, local network, and ngrok for testing
  - Production: Restricts to configured `FRONTEND_URL` only
- **Vite Dev Server**: `host: '0.0.0.0'` and `allowedHosts` are development-only
  - Safe behind home/office router (not exposed to internet)
  - Settings ignored in production builds (serves static files)
- **Apple Pay/Google Pay**: Requires HTTPS on desktop browsers
  - Use ngrok or production deployment for desktop testing
  - Works on mobile devices over HTTP (local network)

## Database Schema Changes

### Order Model Updates (Phase 5)
Added support for guest orders with nullable user relationship:

```prisma
model Order {
  userId            String?       @map("user_id")
  guestEmail        String?       @map("guest_email")
  guestFirstName    String?       @map("guest_first_name")
  guestLastName     String?       @map("guest_last_name")
  user              User?         @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

  @@index([guestEmail])
}
```

**Migration**: `20251009000000_add_guest_checkout_support.sql`

### MenuItem Model Updates (Multi-Weekday Support)
Changed single weekday field to array for multiple weekday assignments:

```prisma
model MenuItem {
  weekdays        Weekday[]     @default([])  // Changed from: weekday Weekday

  @@index([isActive])  // Removed weekday from index
}
```

**Migration**: `20251010000000_add_multiple_weekdays_support.sql`

**Data Migration Steps**:
1. Adds `weekdays` array column with default empty array
2. Migrates existing `weekday` value to `weekdays` array: `UPDATE menu_items SET weekdays = ARRAY[weekday]`
3. Drops old `weekday` column
4. Updates index from `(weekday, isActive)` to `(isActive)` only

## API Endpoints

### Guest Order Endpoints (Phase 5)
- `POST /api/v1/orders/guest` - Create guest order (no authentication required)
  - Request body: `{ items, deliveryNotes, guestInfo: { firstName, lastName, email } }`
  - Returns: `{ order, clientSecret }` or `409` if email exists
- `GET /api/v1/orders/guest/:id` - Retrieve guest order by ID (no authentication required)

### Updated Menu Endpoints
