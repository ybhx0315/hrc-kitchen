# Phase 2 Complete - Order Placement & Payment Checkout

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: ✅ All features implemented and tested

## Summary
Phase 2 of the HRC Kitchen MVP is now complete. Users can now place orders, pay with credit cards via Stripe, and view their order history. The complete user journey from menu browsing to order confirmation is functional and tested.

## Features Implemented

### Backend (API)
1. **Order API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/v1/orders` - Create new order with payment
   - `GET /api/v1/orders` - Get user's order history
   - `GET /api/v1/orders/:id` - Get specific order details

2. **Order Service** (`backend/src/services/order.service.ts`)
   - Order creation with database transactions
   - Stripe PaymentIntent integration
   - Ordering window validation (8:00 AM - 10:30 AM, weekdays only)
   - Order number generation (format: ORD-YYYYMMDD-####)
   - Price calculation and validation
   - Customizations and special requests handling

3. **Data Models**
   - Order model with payment tracking
   - OrderItem model with pricing snapshots
   - Payment status and fulfillment status enums
   - JSON storage for customizations

### Frontend (UI)
1. **Checkout Page** (`frontend/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx`)
   - Order summary with itemized list
   - Delivery notes input field
   - Stripe Elements card payment form
   - Payment processing with loading states
   - Error handling and user feedback

2. **Order Confirmation Page** (`frontend/src/pages/OrderConfirmationPage.tsx`)
   - Success message with order details
   - Order number and timestamps
   - Payment and fulfillment status
   - Itemized order list with prices
   - Navigation to order history

3. **Orders History Page** (`frontend/src/pages/OrdersPage.tsx`)
   - List of all user orders (newest first)
   - Order cards with key information
   - Status badges (payment and fulfillment)
   - "View Details" links to confirmation page
   - Empty state with "Browse Menu" CTA

### Routes Added
- `/checkout` - Payment checkout page
- `/order-confirmation/:orderId` - Order success page
- `/orders` - Order history page

## Technical Highlights

### Key Decisions
1. **Static Payment Service**: PaymentService uses static methods since it's stateless
2. **Transaction Safety**: Order and payment creation wrapped in Prisma transactions
3. **Type Conversion**: Prisma Decimal types converted to numbers on frontend
4. **Payment Flow**: PaymentIntent created before order, clientSecret returned to frontend

### Schema Alignment
The implementation properly aligns with the Prisma schema:
- `Order.paymentStatus` and `Order.fulfillmentStatus` (not generic "status")
- `Order.specialRequests` (not "deliveryNotes")
- `Order.orderDate` (Date type for delivery date)
- `OrderItem.customizations` (JSONB storage)
- Payment tracking via `Order.paymentId` (not separate Payment table)

## User Flow (Tested End-to-End)

1. **Browse Menu** → User views daily menu items
2. **Add to Cart** → Items added with quantities and customizations
3. **View Cart** → Cart drawer shows all items with totals
4. **Checkout** → Navigate to checkout page
5. **Enter Payment** → User enters card details (Stripe Elements)
6. **Submit Order** → Order created, payment processed
7. **Confirmation** → Success page with order details
8. **View History** → User can see all past orders
9. **View Details** → Click any order to see full details

## Test Cards (Stripe Test Mode)
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Use any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVC

## Next Phase: Kitchen Dashboard
The next phase will focus on building the kitchen dashboard for order management:
1. View incoming orders grouped by delivery date
2. Mark orders as "Preparing" or "Ready"
3. Filter and search orders
4. Print order slips
5. Daily order summary reports
